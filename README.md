ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a data engineer with a passion for coding and building awesome web apps. My ultimate goal is to become a master in Artificial Intelligence ðŸ¤–, but for now, I'm enjoying the journey and learning as much as I can. When I'm not working on data pipelines or building APIs, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading up on the latest trends in tech, or sipping on a cup of coffee â˜•. Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
